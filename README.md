Created a simple and basic Currency converter app with react native and learned a lot of basic things about react native and its components.
Tried to add some special features to it like:
Simple Interface: Our app offers a clean and user-friendly interface, making currency conversion hassle-free for users of all levels.
Real-Time Exchange Rates: Stay updated with the latest exchange rates, ensuring accurate conversions every time you use the app.
Multiple Currency Support: Convert between a wide range of currencies from around the world, covering all major currencies.
Offline Access: Even without an internet connection, our app allows you to access previously loaded exchange rates and perform conversions, ensuring uninterrupted usage.
